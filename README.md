# atari-adventure
An Atari Adventure RPG

This is a work-in-progress. I am making something to test out some ideas I have for pushing some of the limits of the Atari 8-bit. 

This project uses a Sublime Text 3 project file which contains the build command, cl65, and the list of files to build. Please see that file to see the latest list of files included in the build phase.
